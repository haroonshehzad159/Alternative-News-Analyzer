## üìñ Project Overview

This project is a web-based application designed to combat the effects of "filter bubbles" and promote media literacy. In an age of algorithmic content curation, it's easy to be exposed to only a single viewpoint. This tool empowers users to see the bigger picture.

By simply providing a URL to a news article, the application performs a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis to:
1.  **Extract Key Topics:** Identifies the core themes and concepts of the article, moving beyond simple keywords to understand the context.
2.  **Analyze Sentiment:** Calculates the overall emotional tone of the article (positive, negative, neutral).
3.  **Find Alternative Perspectives:** Intelligently searches for related articles from a wide range of news sources.
4.  **Provide Comparative Analysis:** Displays the alternative articles alongside their own sentiment scores, allowing for a direct comparison of how different outlets are reporting on the same event.

This project was developed as part of an MSc thesis.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Simple URL Input:** Easy-to-use interface, just paste a link to get started.
-   **Contextual Topic Modeling:** Uses `BERTopic` to find high-quality, meaningful topics, including important two-word phrases (n-grams).
-   **Robust Sentiment Analysis:** Employs `NLTK VADER` for fast and effective sentiment scoring.
-   **Intelligent Article Search:**
    -   Leverages `spaCy` for Named Entity Recognition to find the most important people, places, and organizations.
    -   Combines entities and topic keywords to create a powerful and relevant search query.
    -   Uses a dual-API fallback system (`GNews.io` and `NewsAPI.org`) to maximize the chances of finding relevant articles.
-   **Clean, Comparative UI:** A modern user interface built with Streamlit that presents complex information in a clear and easy-to-understand format.
-   **Resilient and Robust:** Gracefully handles short articles, article fetching failures, and API errors without crashing.
